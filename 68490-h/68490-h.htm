<h3>
I.  HIS ART AND CHARACTER
</h3>

<p>
Portraits painted by Sir Joshua Reynolds
are a national asset, and appeal to the general
public in this light almost as strongly as they
appeal to the smaller section that takes a
definite interest in pictures.  The value of
the portraits varies considerably; it is probable
that the artist produced between four and five
thousand in his time, sometimes completing
three or four in a week for years on end, and
even in his more leisured times producing
six or seven per month, so it was of course
inevitable that their value should not be
equal.  The very early work painted in
Devonshire is of little worth.  Italy opened
the eyes of Joshua Reynolds as it has opened
the eyes of so many British artists since his
time.  Fortunate in his life the painter was;
in a certain sense, unfortunate in his art.  The
beauty he has committed to canvas had begun
to pass before the artist's days were numbered,
and many of his most successful works are
to-day no more than a pale reflection of their
former selves, a remnant most forlorn of
what they were.  One of his most painstaking
biographers and soundest critics, Sir Walter
Armstrong, has written, "Speaking roughly,
Sir Joshua's early pictures darken, the works
of his middle period fade, those of his late
maturity crack."
</p>

<p>
"Despite these drawbacks, the painter's
position is unassailable, for it appeals alike to
the historian, to the philosopher who looks
to the outward semblance for reflection of
the spirit behind the mask, and to the artist
who finds so much to delight him in the
point of achievement to which Reynolds
raised portrait painting and can appreciate
the larger aspect of work that is visible in
some degree to everybody.
</p>

<p>
The man was a sturdy Briton, he worked
hard all the days of his life, he had a large
measure of shrewd common sense, great
gifts, high ideals, and sufficient human
weakness to make him what the Spaniards call
"hombre como alquier otro," a man like any
other.  His art may stand upon a pedestal
but he never did, he was too busy and too
unaffected to pose.  "I'll be a painter if
you'll give me a chance to be quite a good
one," he is reported to have said, when a
little boy, to his father, the Plympton
school-master, and once a painter he worked on
and on, enjoying life but never abusing it,
until 1789, when he was sixty-six, and
apparently in the mellow autumn of his days.
Then as he was painting in his studio one July
morning, the sight of one eye failed him
suddenly.  Quite quietly he laid his brushes
down.  "All things have an end," he said;
"I have come to mine."  Some two and a
half years were left to him but he would not
paint any more; he preferred to be judged by
the tasks he had accomplished in the light of
health.  He continued to address the students
of the Royal Academy; he consented to
remain titular head of that body though Sir
William Chambers and Benjamin West, who
was regarded as a great painter in his day,
looked after the actual work of the high
office.  He was not a mere cipher in the
counsels of the Academy on that account; to
the end he had his own way.  Very masterful,
very human, very kind, he stands out
the most prominent figure in an age that
produced both Gainsborough and Romney.

Reynolds painted three portraits of this famous
courtesan, all of which have been engraved.  The
one reproduced here, in which she wears a straw
hat that throws a skilfully expressed shadow over
her face, and in which she has a Maltese terrier on

at least three times.

<hr />

<p>
The latter half of the eighteenth century
owes a heavy debt to Sir Joshua, so too do we
who turn to his many canvases for a glimpse
of the men who bore rule and the women
they delighted to honour&mdash;or dishonour.
He has preserved for us all that was
notable&mdash;statesmen, soldiers, sailors, churchmen, men
of letters, actors, fair women, frail women,
delightful children&mdash;they are all there, and if
we cannot see them all quite in their habit
as they lived, there is enough left to give a
very fair idea.  The modern market carefully
nursed by a ring of astute professionals will give
almost any price for portraits of fair women
by Sir Joshua, though it may be suggested
that his greatest success was in the treatment
of men or at least that he saw far more in
men than in women.  But Reynolds had not
studied classic figures for nothing, he could
give his fair sitters some suggestion of direct
association with those goddesses of old time
whom he had admired in Italy, and to this
treatment no exception was taken.  It is
very rarely that Reynolds makes his women
human.  Nellie O'Brien, whose portrait hangs
in the Wallace Collection, is one of the
exceptions, and an attempt is made to make the
"Duchess of Devonshire and Child," now at
Chatsworth, equally feminine, but one cannot
escape the thought that the mother's gesture
as expressed on the canvas is altogether
exceptional.  She could not have played for
long with such a strong healthy baby without
ruffling the delightful costume or the carefully
arranged hair, and this, one feels, would
have been unendurable.  Turn, on the other
hand, to the portraits of the men&mdash;how
significantly their faces speak of their
outstanding habits, labours or desires.  Few
people could see so closely into his sitters as
Sir Joshua did, though in very many cases
they were not with him for more than a couple
of days.  Yet he seemed able in that short
time to enter into their life history to produce
something that was a fine portrait and yet
more than a portrait&mdash;a psychological study,
not over elaborated, not insisted upon, not
in any way intruding upon the purely artistic
side of the work, but there, nevertheless, to be
seen to-day by those who have eyes to see.
To quote his own words, he looked upon his
sitters "with a dilated eye"; there was just
enough imagination to give an attractive
setting to the essentials; there was no need for
the classical or symbolical background to
whose doubtful charms the painter surrendered
now and again, but we may consider that
these affectations were a part of the art of his
time, and that, while he left many conventions
behind him, he could not trample upon them
all.
</p>

<p>
It is well to remember that Sir Joshua was
not a heaven-sent genius, and that he arrived
at the perfection of his achievement by the
addition of hard labour to a considerable
natural gift.  He started out with few
advantages save those that come to the young
man who finds a patron early in life; he had
many natural errors of taste to correct.
Students of his life and correspondence will
find many evidences to prove that the first
President of the Royal Academy mastered
his self-control, taste, and bearing towards
patrons as he mastered his art, slowly and
not without difficulty, but that as soon as a
lesson was mastered it was retained for all
time.  The raw country lad from Devonshire
could not become all at once one of the
prominent figures in the society of his time.
</p>

<p>
This is as it was bound to be&mdash;the people
who make no mistakes, who say and do the
right thing under all circumstances, who are,
so to speak, ready made and with every
modern equipment, are for the most part the
creation of their biographers.  They have
not and never had a real existence as paragons
of progress and propriety.  There was a
time when Joshua Reynolds was not very
competent, and but incompletely educated;
he became highly accomplished and well
read.  There was a time when he exhibited
the tendencies of a snob; he learned to lay
them aside, and once abandoned he had no
further use for them.  Unceasing endeavour
stimulated and refined him, he achieved
greatness not for himself alone but also for
British art.  Before his day the most of the
fashionable portrait painters were foreigners.
Rubens and Van Dyck had many successors
and followers though they had no peers, but
after Reynolds had made his mark it was no
longer considered necessary to employ foreign
talent.  The commanding ability of the
painter was associated with the easy authority
of the man of the world.  Leaders of English
society found that Sir Joshua, despite his
deafness, was a fascinating companion.  He shot
and hunted with them, he ate and drank with
them, he entertained them in fashion that
smacked more of the country than of the
town.  Dr Johnson would suggest that he
sometimes took more than was absolutely
necessary for his well-being, but then the
doctor thought that all drinking, save
tea-drinking, was gross indulgence.  From his
close acquaintance with men of mark and
women of social distinction came the intimacy
that the portraits reveal, the quality that
counts for so much in portraiture.  There
were other attractions greatly admired then
and lost now, for Sir Joshua gave his pictures
a fine glaze that is said to have added much
to the beauty of the colouring, but was, alas,
ephemeral.  It was purely experimental, and
when we consider the scientific resources of
the middle eighteenth century it is hardly
surprising to find that the charm did not
endure.  For all we know to the contrary
this purely evanescent quality constituted one
of the charms of Reynolds while he lived,
but his fame rests upon more enduring
foundations.  We look in vain to the spoken
and written word or to the written word
alone to sum up eighteenth century men of
thought and action as clearly and definitely as
Sir Joshua has done; his is a sincerity devoid
of prejudice.  We see men as they were
even if the most of his women are seen as
they would have wished to be.  Here then
is a part at least of the charm of Sir Joshua
Reynolds, the man was very human and
very discreet.  He was by no means free
from jealousy notably where Gainsborough
and Romney were concerned; he knew well
enough that they were great competitors and
formidable.  He lived a bachelor, and despite
all the Paul Prys among his contemporaries
the story of his amours (if any) remains
untold.  Here at least is a fine and ample
discretion.  It is with Angelica Kauffmann
that his name has been associated.  We
know he was her friend and admirer, and
that she was one of the two lady members
of the Royal Academy as first constituted,
but there is little more than this at the
disposal of the conscientious biographer.  Sir
Joshua was not the only man to succumb to
her charms; in years to come Goethe himself
was to acknowledge them.  It is pleasant to
think that whatever the great painter's private
affairs may have been, they have remained
private for all time.  What a wealth of
moralising this condition has enabled us to
escape!  We are left to concern ourselves
solely with his progress as artist and as man,
and there is quite enough in this as may be
gathered from study of the artist's leading
biographers.  Sir Walter Armstrong, Sir
Claude Phillips among the moderns, and
Northcote and Leslie and Taylor among
those nearer to the artist, are men who have
left little for those who endeavour to glean in
the field of biography.  They have done
more than write the story of one man's
life&mdash;they have given us a valuable glimpse of
contemporary history.  It is a grateful task
to write at considerable length of Sir Joshua,
because of his association with so many
leaders of contemporary thought and action.
Detail is out of the question in this brief note,
but the outlines of the strenuous and honourable
life may be set out here.

<h3>
II.  HIS LIFE AND TIMES
</h3>

<p>
Joshua Reynolds was born at Plympton
in Devonshire in the month of July 1723.
His father, the Rev. Samuel Reynolds,
master of the local grammar school, was
a scholar, and gave his boy the best
education at his command, intending to make
him a doctor when he grew up.  But the
lad's talent developed early, his hands were
busy with the pencil at a very early age, and
at a time when to most lads reading is a
labour rather than a pastime, he was mastering
the elements of perspective and studying a
"Theory of Painting" by one Richardson.  This
precocious interest in art was not to be
overlooked, and the Rev. Samuel Reynolds giving
up the idea of the medical profession for
his son, sent him in his seventeenth year to
London as pupil to a portrait painter named
Thomas Hudson, a man of some temporary
repute.  He stayed there for three years, and
then a series of troubles with his master
culminated in a final quarrel, and the boy,
for he was hardly more, left London for his
native county, and set up in Devonport as
a portrait painter.  His gift was already
sufficient to gain recognition, and the patronage of
local people was neither denied nor delayed.
Among them was Lord Mount Edgecumbe,
who was not content to have his portrait
painted, but, being convinced that the young
artist had talent, did all that in him lay to
help its development.  Portraits were painted
in large numbers at Devonport, many are
known to-day, but for the most part they
are not classed with the master's great
achievements.  A natural gift and three
years' association with Thomas Hudson could
not make the Reynolds we know and admire.
It was for Italy to do this and Lord Mount
Edgecumbe made Italy possible by introducing
his protégé to Commodore Keppel, a distinguished
sailor, who, on receiving a Mediterranean
command in 1749, invited his clever
friend to accompany him.  Naturally the offer
was not slighted; by the summer of 1749
the young painter was in the Eternal City
copying masterpieces.  But he did not copy
in any slavish fashion; it was his firm belief,
and one he was to expound to students in
days to come, that copying is a delusive
industry and keeps the gifts of composition
and invention dormant, so that for lack of
proper exercise they lose their vitality.  His
mind was at once synthetical and analytical; he
set himself to discover the foundation of the
excellence of the masterpieces, and many of
his copies were in a sense mere notes for
his own future guidance.  He wanted assistance
to develop himself; he had no wish to
speak in the language of any of the mighty
dead.  Yet his power of making an effective
copy must have been remarkable.  Sir Walter
Armstrong, to whose life of Reynolds
reference has been made already, thinks that one
of the Rembrandts in our National Gallery
is no more than the copy by Sir Joshua of an
original.  For three years the painter laboured
diligently, not only among the Michelangelos
in Rome, but among the works of lesser men
in Padua, Turin, Milan, and Paris.  He had
learned enough in England to call the old
masters to his aid on the Continent, he could
appreciate all their canvases could tell him and,
when he returned home in his thirtieth year,
he was fully equipped to take a high place
among his fellow artists and to pave the way
to a supremacy that only Gainsborough and
Romney could challenge.
</p>

<p>
He had not come unscathed through more
than three years of foreign travel, a fall from
his horse in the island of Minorca left his
face permanently scarred.  Far more serious
was the chill contracted in the Vatican that
brought about the deafness from which he
suffered for the rest of his life.  He reached
Devonshire in the autumn of 1752, took a
brief holiday there, and then, on the advice of
his patron Lord Mount Edgecumbe, decided
to try his fortune in London.  Some of his
biographers say he went to Great Newport
Street, but it is more correct to say that his
first studio was in St Martin's Street, from
which he moved to Great Newport Street,
staying there till 1760, when he made his
last change to 47 Leicester Square, a house
still standing and largely devoted to auction
rooms to-day.

<p class="caption">
This delightful study of a little barefooted girl,
wearing a white dress and seated on the grass, was
bought for the Nation at the sale of Mr Harman's
pictures.  It has been engraved by S. W. Reynolds,
Chas. Turner, and others, but the sitter has not
been traced.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
One of his first London portraits was a
full length study of his sailor friend Keppel,
and that piece of work seems to have been
the foundation of his London fortunes; he
never looked back.  Soon the studio was
crowded; one sitter succeeded another; the
painter had no time to do more than work.
His household affairs were watched by his
sister Frances, who does not appear to have
been an ideal housekeeper when the work of
the house grew and it became necessary to
entertain and be prepared to receive friends
at any reasonable hour.  The painter grew
rich rapidly, and when he moved, in 1760, to
the house in Leicester Square, sister Frances
would drive about the town in a gilded coach
with coachman and footman in staring liveries.
Presumably the equipage served to advertise
the painter's prosperity.
</p>

<p>
For many men the rapid success would
not have been good, they would have ceased
to strive and would have been content to
repeat themselves, but Joshua Reynolds,
with his high ideals and genuine enthusiasm
for work, was only stimulated by prosperity;
it was powerless to spoil him.  While his
work was increasing in power he was selecting
friends from the ranks of the most
distinguished scholars and thinkers in town, and
while his labours were making him a bigger
artist, the association with great intellects
was making him a bigger man.  The friendship
of Edmund Burke and Dr Samuel
Johnson alone would have been enough to
have lent distinction to the painter's life.  He
was a great admirer of the lexicographer, and
has left an appreciation of his character, while
the old man's last words to him were an
exhortation to read the Bible regularly and
not to paint on Sundays.
</p>

<p>
To many people Reynolds is known best
as the first President of the Royal Academy,
and it is necessary in dealing, however
briefly, with the story of his life to point out
how the Academy came into being.  Down
to the middle of the eighteenth century
exhibitions of modern work would appear to
have been unknown.  London's interest in
fine arts was strictly limited.  People with
plenty of money hired an artist to paint their
portrait much as we should hire a painter
and decorator to put a house in good order.
Artists had comparatively little standing and
no representative institution; art was patronised
by a small section of the wealthy classes,
and the masses knew little and cared less
about the existence of even leading men.
The Society of Arts was founded about
1754, and a Society of Artists was founded
soon afterwards.  Hogarth had given some
pictures to the gallery of the Foundling
Hospital, established by his great friend
Captain Coram.  Reynolds' former master,
Thomas Hudson, Reynolds himself, and
several others sent pictures; the gallery was
open to the public and people visited it
with interest and pleasure.  The possibilities
of regular exhibitions of modern work
became suddenly apparent then, and members
began to form associations for the development
of common interests.  The Society of
Artists received in 1765 a certificate of
Incorporation from King George III., and
became the Incorporated Society of Artists
of Great Britain with a membership of more
than two hundred.  Now in this country it
is only necessary to establish one society in
order that several other societies may establish
themselves in opposition, emulation,
imitation or something of the kind, and it was
quite in the order of things for the Free
Society of Artists to enter into competition
with the Incorporated Society.  There were
many intrigues, and some of the men who
had the ear of the King, chief among them,
it is said, William Chambers the Architect
and Benjamin West, brought about the
establishment of the Royal Academy.  King
George signed the Constitution of the new
body, which started with thirty-six members
including two ladies, Angelica Kauffmann
and Mary Moser.  William Chambers
accepted the office of Treasurer, while
Goldsmith and Dr Johnson represented
Ancient History and Ancient Literature
respectively.  To the astonishment of many
people the Presidency was offered to Joshua
Reynolds.  His brother artists wanted him,
but King George III., who was not remarkable
for his artistic perceptions, preferred the
work of Benjamin West, and is said to have
been unable at first to subscribe to the
Academy's choice.  The part Reynolds
played in the business that led to the
collapse of the Incorporated Society and the
establishment of the R.A. remain unknown
to this hour.  To all outward seeming he
stood quite aloof from the intrigues, for a
part of the time of their occurrence he was
travelling on the Continent; yet those who
have studied his life history closely and
noted the abundant and subtle diplomacy
that marked his public as well as his private
life, suspect that his influence was behind
many of the developments of those stirring
years.  Be this as it may the fact remains
that he did not at once accept the offer of
the Presidency; he asked time to consider
and to consult his friends, and Benjamin
West was sent to persuade him before he
would give a favourable answer.  What a
pity that there was no painter at hand to
defeat Benjamin West persuading Joshua
Reynolds to become first President of the
Royal Academy!  Certainly, if the latter was
pulling the wires he did the work in fashion
quite inimitable.  Having held out sufficiently
he gave in, and a year later received from
King George the honour of Knighthood.
</p>

<p>
It is characteristic of Sir Joshua Reynolds
that, having become President, he should be
at great pains to justify his new position.
It was not an empty honour, the annual
exhibition would need and demand proof of
his accomplishment and industry, while, as
the Academy was to be a teaching Institution,
he saw himself face to face with the necessity
of finding time to prepare addresses for the
benefit of the students.  Perhaps the best
praise to be given to these discourses on art
is the reminder that they are still in steady
demand, indeed, they are the most accessible
guide to their author's methods.  His grasp
of principles, his breadth of view and critical
insight are all the more attractive because of
the ease and fluency with which they are
expressed.  To the man who has never held
a paint brush as well as to the novice in art and
the old experienced hand, there is a definite
appeal.  He shows one and all that his
triumph as a portrait painter is not a mere
affair of happy chance, but the logical
outcome of certain principles followed without
concession.  Many moderns will not see eye
to eye with him, they may ever hold that he
was quite mistaken in many of his views,
but the change of fashion and the modification
of thought are of less importance than
the fact that Sir Joshua accepted, followed,
and taught certain theories and lived in the
light of them.  Nearly one hundred and fifty
years have passed since the Academy was
established, but it has not produced another
teacher like Reynolds.  He had not exhausted
his honours when he came to be President; in
years to come he was to become painter in
ordinary to the King and to be entrusted
with a considerable commission by that
remarkable woman the Empress Catherine of
Russia.  He was a welcome guest at many of
the most beautiful homes in England and he
travelled abroad extensively, but nothing
kept him from his Presidential duties until
the last year of his life brought sickness in
their train.

<p class="caption">
This picture, sometimes known as "The Jumping
Baby," is in the possession of the Duke of
Devonshire at Chatsworth.  When first seen
some people found fault with it, Horace Walpole
among the number, but it has gained popularity
with age.  The composition is very skilled, but
the Duchess is perhaps rather too much <i>en grande
tenue</i> to appear as nurse.

<p>
When we consider the ill fortune of the
Incorporated Society and the Society of
Artists and remember how actively men
intrigued then, as now, it is not difficult
to see that the Royal Academy owes a heavy
debt to Sir Joshua, who may be said to have
nursed it with the greatest care during its
infancy and was such a generous contributor
to the walls of its annual exhibition that he
is said to have sent nearly two hundred
and fifty pictures during his term of office.
The first Exhibitions were held in Pall Mall,
but during Sir Joshua's lifetime there was
a move to Somerset House.  To 1838 the
annual display was transferred to the National
Gallery, and in 1869 Burlington House became
the centre of activities that increase in volume
if not in interest year by year.
</p>

<p>
It is impossible to compile a list of the
distinguished men and interesting women
who sat to Sir Joshua, but a very brief
resume may be made of some of the most
familiar.  The three Ladies Waldegrave,
Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire, Lady
Cockburn and her children, Mrs Master
as Hebe, Miss Kitty Fisher, Miss Nelly
O'Brien, Mrs Lloyd, the Honourable Lavinia
Bingham, Angelica Kauffmann, Mrs Hoare
and her baby, Countess Waldegrave and
daughter, Mrs Siddons as the Tragic Muse,
The Graces decorating a Terminal Figure
of Hymen, the Duchess of Devonshire and
baby&mdash;here we have a few of the female
portraits by which the painter would have
achieved success if he had painted no others.
</p>

<p>
He painted four or five portraits of King
George III., two of his wife, and two of
George IV. as Prince of Wales; the number
of peers is legion.  Among statesmen Edmund
Burke sat to him five times and Charles
James Fox four.  Brinsley Sheridan sat
twice and Horace Walpole three times.
Other men sitters of note were Bartolozzi
the engraver, Dr Burney, David Garrick,
Dr Johnson, Boswell, Oliver Goldsmith,
Gibbon the historian, Tobias Smollett and
Laurence Sterne.  Of himself Reynolds
painted between forty and fifty portraits.
</p>

<p>
Successful as he was in expressing the
moods of men and the fascination of women,
it is impossible in writing of the charm of
Reynolds to forget the part the children
play in his work.  It would be hard indeed
to find a painter who has expressed the joy
and happiness of childhood with equal effect.
Some of the children so depicted are seen
with their mothers, and one feels that the
portrait was painted more for the mother
than for the child; but there are many canvases
from which the children alone smile at us,
captured for our time in all their youthful
radiance though some have lain for a century
dead.  The children of Lady Smythe stand
happily apart from their rather self-conscious
mother, and among the single-figure portraits
of children are Lady Catherine Pelham Clinton,
Lady Caroline Howard, Miss Emma Hart
(afterwards Lady Hamilton), Charles,
Viscount Althorp, Miss Bowles the Strawberry
Girl, "The Age of Innocence," "The Infant
Samuel," and many others that the mind and the
memory love to dwell upon.  How pleasant
it is to remember that Nature so careless of
the individual is so careful of the type that
it blossoms anew with every generation!
</p>

<p>
Having written, however briefly, of the
children in Reynolds' picture, it seems
unnecessary to say more of his charm; they will
stand for it until the end comes, the hour
when the pigments can endure no longer and
the labour of the master is ended.
</p>

<p>
There is little to add to the story of Sir
Joshua after he became President of the
Royal Academy.  Down to 1789, when
sickness came suddenly upon him, his was
a prosperous career, passed in the most
stimulating company of his age, associated
with foreign travel and delightful English
holidays.  Only once in all these later years
does his critical insight appear to have failed
him, and this was when he went to Holland
and remained unmoved by the work of
Franz Hals.  What, one wonders, did he
see or fail to see when he stood before the
portrait of the Laughing Cavalier and the
musician (Der Vaar), the painter's wife and
the market girl?  Londoners mourned when
Reynolds' life came to an end, and they buried
him with much pomp and ceremony by the
side of Sir Christopher Wren.  But he may
well be content with the measure of his own
immortality.  No British portrait painter has
seriously challenged his supremacy, and few
may hope to rival his output.  The Graves
and Cronin catalogue mention three thousand
pictures and probably leave well over a
thousand unnamed.  It is possible for the
amateur to name a hundred examples of his
portraiture, any of which would have justified
a claim to posthumous honours.
